Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a CBW capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Other groups have acquired a pathogen or toxin and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by law enforcement or exposed by defectors before the attack could be carried out .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology ( socialist / communist policies advocated by Marxist - Leninist or Maoist groups ) or by national - separatist goals ( a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up ) , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
Further details about the motivation and organizational structure of the terrorist groups most likely to carry out CBW attacks are provided in the next two pages. ( The specific capabilities required to acquire and deliver biological agents are discussed in subsequent chapters . )
Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .
No evidence obtained to date suggests that Al Qa'ida has actually succeeded in producing significant quantities of chemical or biological agents or developed an effective means of delivery , but the intention to do so is clearly present .

Patriot groups in rural areas often form armed militias that stockpile weapons and conduct training exercises in preparation for an anticipated violent showdown with the federal government or United Nations forces .
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .

In 2002 China ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol , the first and only nuclear weapons state to do so .
Since 2004 , China has been engaged in consultation with the MTCR ; however , its application for membership has so far not been successful and suspicions , especially in the United States , about Chinese missile technology transfers remain .
Since the early 1990s , China has improved its export controls , including the promulgation of regulations on nuclear and nuclear dual - use exports and has pledged to halt exports of nuclear technology to un - safeguarded facilities .

A transition is currently underway from relatively inaccurate , liquid - fueled , silo / cave - based missiles ( DF-3 , DF -4 , DF -5 ) to more accurate , solid - fueled , mobile missiles ( DF-11 , DF-15 , and DF-21 , and a new ICBM [ the DF-31 ] and SLBM [ the JL-2 ] , which are currently under development ) .
China ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) in December 1996 , declaring two former chemical weapons ( CW ) production facilities that may have produced mustard gas and Lewisite .
China is replacing its older DF-5 missiles with new DF -5A variants , which may eventually be equipped with multiple warheads .
Improved export control laws and enforcement have addressed many ( but not all ) concerns about nuclear and chemical weapons - related proliferation .

Although China claims that it no longer possesses any CW stockpiles , the U.S. government believes that China has not revealed the full scope of its program .
The majority of these reports cite Iranian attempts to purchase fusaria from Canada and the Netherlands as evidence that Iran is working on a covert weapons program .
Sources also claim that Iran has pursued the acquisition of castor beans ( known to be used for producing the deadly toxin ricin ) and retains several cultures of the anthrax - producing bacteria Bacillus anthracis .
AKU 's Biomaterials Laboratory is the largest university laboratory fostering research in the area of synthesis , processing , and modification of materials for use in biological environments .
In 2002 , AKU and Damascus University signed a mutual scientific cooperation agreement that called for broadened scientific , educational , and research cooperation between the universities , the exchange of professors and students , the organization of scientific seminars and educational courses , and the formation of a joint working committee to probe into the inauguration of a branch of Amir Kabir University in Syria .

While the two strains of fusaria Iran requested are in fact dangerous to animal and human nervous systems , Schiefer contended that the toxins ( T-2 and related `` trichothecene mycotoxins '' ) produced by the fungi would not kill quickly enough to be an effective agent .
Under the deal , India will build a sophisticate chemical plant at Qazvin , which will be used produce phosphorous pentasulfide , a dual - use chemical that could be used to produce chemical weapons .
In 1997 , two more Chinese companies and were sanctioned by the US State Department for selling Iran CW related precursors and equipment .
In 1997 , Rex International Development Company Ltd. , a company affiliated with the Chinese company Norinco , supplied Iran with high - grade seamless steel pipes , suitable for handling corrosive materials , and associated with chemical weapons production .
Also in 1989 , the State Trading Corporation of India admitted that it had sold Iran over 60 tons of thionyl chloride ( a nerve agent precursor ) and that its supplier was planning to ship an additional 257 tons of the chemical to Iran .
While several Iranian leaders felt that developing a CW program would counteract the Iraqi threat and prove to be a strong deterrent , others within the clerical Islamic regime publicly condemned any use of chemicals on moral grounds , calling them un - Islamic .
`` With the aid of Indian companies , Iran is nearing the completion of a secret poison - gas plant , which was claimed by the Indian companies to be a pesticide factory . ''
According to an intelligence report , cited by the Washington Times on 30 October 1997 , China completed construction in June 1997 of a dual - use plant in Iran for making glass - lined equipment used in producing chemical weapons .
According to an intelligence report , cited by the Washington Times on 30 October 1997 , China completed construction in June 1997 of a dual - use plant in Iran for making glass - lined equipment used in producing chemical weapons .
On 8 March 1996 , the Washington Post reported , `` US intelligence officials have concluded that companies in China are providing Iran with several virtually complete factories suited for making deadly poison gases , '' and that Iranian `` military - related organizations '' are buying from China glass - lined vessels for mixing precursors , special air - filtration equipment , and the technology to manufacture these items and others indigenously .
The report mentions the sale of 58,000 gas masks by Shalon Chemical Industries after the Iran - Iraq War as well as the supply of gas detectors by Elbit for the identification of chemical warfare agents .
In 1984 , East Germany ( GDR ) supplied Iran with 5,000 `` respirators , '' which turned out to be industrial half - masks with goggles , which are unsuitable for chemical defense .

The 1979 revolution ended all nuclear efforts until 1984 , when Iran revived the nuclear power program and reportedly began covert procurement for a nuclear weapon program .
In April 2004 , Iran vowed to step up cooperation with the IAEA , adding that it had not only suspended enrichment programs but also stopped producing and assembling related parts .
U.S. intelligence agencies assess that barring acquisition of a complete system or major subsystem from North Korea , Iran is unlikely to launch an ICBM or satellite launch vehicle ( SLV ) before mid - decade .
It fears that the deal is being used as a cover for the transfer of more sensitive nuclear technology to Iran and to provide training for Iranian nuclear specialists that could be used to support a nuclear weapons program .

By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .

As of late 2003 , Iran possesses the second largest ballistic missile force in the third world ( behind that of the DPRK ) and is on the verge of developing a space launch vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missiles .
Specifically , during the visit to the PRC , he secured a PRC agreement in the following missile - related areas : The delivery of HY-1 silkworm and HY-2 seersucker coastal defense missiles beginning in 1986 and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these missiles .
In both countries , Hashemi - Rafsanjani secured increased military assistance and agreements to sell Iranian missiles and engage in bilateral missile technology exchanges .
Iran believes that a strong missile force is critical to its security and acts as a deterrent to foreign ( especially US ) aggression .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Iran would advance from assembly to production of the Shehab-1 .
Iran currently possesses the capability to employ ballistic missiles and/or long - range artillery rockets against its regional neighbors , Israel , and US forces deployed in the region .

China is believed to have assisted in the construction of a ballistic missile plant where scientists carry out research using Russian SS-4 ballistic missile technology and produce other ballistic missile technologies .
The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
Today , it possesses the second largest ( behind the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- DPRK ) ballistic missile force in the third world and is near to developing a space launch vehicle and medium - range and intercontinental ballistic missiles that could threaten Europe and the continental United States .

The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
US - led Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom -- while first reducing and then eliminating the military threat from Iraq -- have also crystallized within the Iranian military and political leadership the concepts on ballistic and cruise missiles and long - range artillery rockets : they are essential tools on the modern battlefield ; key elements in regional power status and prestige ; and essential to deter Israel and the United States from aggressive actions against Iran .
This assistance has included the sale of production and missile component technologies , training of personnel , construction of the Shahrud Missile Test Facility , and the assembly and production of the M-7 ( a.k.a. , CSS-8 , 8610 or B610 ) .
This 320km range is the range of the Shehab-1 ( i.e. , Hwasong-5 ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Scud-B. It is unlikely that the Iranians manufactured these missiles , but rather they were assembled from components provided by the DPRK .
Faced with probability of sanctions and international isolation in case of noncompliance with the IAEA 's demands , Iran announced on 21 October 2003 that it will cooperate with the IAEA with full transparency and disclosure , sign the Additional Protocol and commence its ratification procedures , and suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities , albeit for an `` interim period . ''
The fear was that Iran might learn how to construct a similar clandestine facility and then produce weapons - grade uranium undetected .
Reports in Western press and leaks from Western government and intelligence sources indicated that Pakistan had trained Iranian scientists in plutonium extraction and possibly gas centrifuge enrichment research .
All ICBMs were transferred to Russia for dismantlement by September 1996 and missile silos and silo structures were destroyed under the U.S. Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction ( CTR ) program by September 1999 .
The plant 's construction was halted in 1987 , after the Soviet Union became involved in Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) -related negotiations , so it never produced any CW agents .
Under Cooperative Threat Reduction ( CTR ) programs , Biomedpreparat has been dismantled and safety and security have been upgraded at SCQZI and SRAI .
Kazakhstan transferred all of these nuclear warheads to Russia by April 1995 and destroyed the nuclear testing infrastructure at Semipalatinsk by July 2000 .

IAEA chief El Baradei indicated that signing the Protocol would ensure IAEA oversight over Libya 's nuclear transition from weapons creation to peaceful purposes . 
Libya admitted having secretly imported raw uranium and the necessary equipment to convert it for enrichment into weapons-grade material but added that the enrichment plan had been dismantled and that no highly enriched uranium had been produced over the past decade . 
Libya has shown interest in and taken steps to acquire weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and their delivery systems . 
There are allegations that the alleged chemical weapon ( CW ) plants at Rabta and Tarhunah could contain BW research facilities as well . 
Libya 's motivation to acquire WMD , and ballistic missiles in particular , appears in part to be a response to Israel 's clandestine nuclear program and a desire to become a more active player in Middle_Eastern and African politics . 
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
Because chemical weapons are best suited for delivery with larger caliber artillery pieces , it is worth noting that over the last two years the North has further increased the number of long - range 240 mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170 mm howitzers , all placed in hardened sites near the DMZ .

If official reports and testimonies from North Korean defectors are to be believed , the DPRK military possesses between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons .
Following this period of Soviet - led assistance , North Korea made substantive gains in the area of chemical warfare .
A South Korean security analyst suggested that DPRK artillery pieces of calibers 170 mm and 240 mm `` could fire 10,000 rounds per minute to Seoul and its environs . ''
The U.S. responded by announcing in November 2002 that it would suspend heavy fuel oil shipments being provided under the terms of the Agreed Framework , which had led North Korea to freeze its plutonium production facilities . 
Discrepancies between North Korean declarations and IAEA inspection findings indicate that North Korea might have reprocessed enough plutonium for one or two nuclear weapons . 
Estimates vary on how soon North Korea could begin operating a uranium enrichment plant , but North Korea probably could not produce significant quantities of weapons-grade HEU until the end of the decade .

Estimates vary on how soon North Korea could begin operating a uranium enrichment plant , but North Korea probably could not produce significant quantities of weapons-grade HEU until the end of the decade . 
Pyongyang then declared the following month that it was lifting the freeze on its nuclear program , ostensibly to generate electricity . 
According to a December 2001 National Intelligence Council report , the U.S. intelligence community ascertained in the mid-1990s that North Korea had produced one , possibly two , nuclear weapons . 
In late December 2002 , North Korean technicians broke seals and disabled cameras that had been installed by the IAEA in order to monitor the freeze . 
The IAEA has not been able to verify the completeness and correctness of North Korea 's initial declaration submitted in 1992 , and the Agency cannot verify whether fissile material has been diverted to military use . 
In December 2002 , Spanish and American naval forces intercepted a North Korean ship loaded with Scud missiles , but then allowed the ship to proceed to deliver the missiles to Yemen .

For example , they may purchase raw or milled uranium ore from abroad , and then use indigenous facilities to enrich it to weapons - grade material .
A plutonium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , process it into reactor fuel , transform the isotopic content of the fuel by `` burning '' it in a reactor , extract plutonium from the spent fuel , form the plutonium into the core of a fission - implosion weapon , and develop and test high explosives used to initiate fission .

Key data sources for DPRK include defector testimony , which may be unreliable given possibility of deliberate disinformation by double agents and defectors exaggerating what they know , and unclassified estimates by US intelligence agencies , which may have certain biases based on national interest , worst - case expectations , domestic politics , etc. Also , most estimates do not rely on original texts in Korean , which may introduce some errors due to translation issues .
However , all countries known to have successfully acquired nuclear weapons have done so primarily on the basis of indigenously produced fissile material .
Analytic tools include examining statements and articles in the news media , government reports including unclassified intelligence estimates , interviewing insiders who have had access to information about the clandestine program , reviewing secondary sources such as reports by analysts , and making scientific calculations based on the best available information about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .

By the early 1970s , North Korean engineers were using indigenous technology to expand the IRT- 2000 research reactor and Pyongyang began to acquire plutonium reprocessing technology from the Soviet Union .
Many analysts now believe the talks are dead , and in early May 2005 there were reports that Washington and Tokyo were preparing to refer the issue to the UN Security Council .
In September 2003 , a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said that North Korea had completed the reprocessing of this spent fuel , which would give North Korea enough plutonium for about four to six nuclear bombs .
From Washington 's perspective , `` improved implementation of the Agreed Framework '' meant an acceleration of safeguards inspections , even though the agreement did not require Pyongyang to submit to full safeguards inspections to verify its past activities until a significant portion of the reactor construction was completed but before the delivery of critical reactor components .
Six rounds of inspections began in May 1992 and concluded in February 1993 .
North and South Korea then signed the `` Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , '' whereby both sides promised `` not test , manufacture , produce , receive , possess , store , deploy or use nuclear weapons . ''
In exchange , the United States agreed to lead an international consortium to construct two light water power reactors , and provide 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil per year until the first reactor came online with a target date of 2003 .
Pyongyang said it was lifting the freeze to generate electricity to compensate for the loss of HFO supplies , and North Korean technicians were able to remove seals and disable monitoring cameras at nuclear facilities in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun within a matter of days .

This action worsened the emerging crisis because the random placement of the spent fuel rods in a temporary storage pond compromised the IAEA 's capacity to reconstruct the operational history of the reactor , which could have been used in efforts to account for the discrepancies in Pyongyang 's reported plutonium reprocessing .

Under the terms of the agreement , North Korea provided an `` initial declaration '' of its nuclear facilities and materials , provided access for IAEA inspectors to verify the completeness and correctness of the initial declaration .
Some of technology and equipment acquired during this period had dual - use applications for a uranium enrichment program that was not revealed until the late 1990s .
Those who believe North Korea is a revisionist state argue that Pyongyang 's nuclear motivations constitute a serious external threat .
Pyongyang 's initial declaration included a small plutonium sample ( less than 100 grams ) , which North Korean officials said was reprocessed from damaged spent fuel rods that were removed from the 5MW ( e ) reactor in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun .
In the late 1960s , North Korea continued to expand its educational and research institutions to support a nuclear program for both civilian and military applications .
In the late 1960s , North Korea continued to expand its educational and research institutions to support a nuclear program for both civilian and military applications .
Initially , North Korea claimed it had no intention of producing nuclear weapons , and that the lifting of the nuclear freeze was necessary to generate needed electricity .
The United States responded in December 2002 by suspending heavy oil shipments , and North Korea then retaliated by lifting the freeze on its nuclear facilities , expelling IAEA inspectors monitoring that freeze , and announcing its withdrawal from the NPT on 10 January 2003 .
If the spent fuel in the reactor core is reprocessed , North Korea will be able to obtain enough weapons - grade plutonium for 1 - 3 nuclear bombs .
The small research reactor has been used to produce radioisotopes and to train personnel .
In the early 1950s , North Korea began establishing the institutional base to train the human resources for its nuclear development program .
North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test , but in early May 2005 , press reports indicated that U.S. satellite imagery had detected signs that North Korea could be preparing for a nuclear test to be conducted in June .
