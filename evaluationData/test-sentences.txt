Al Qa'ida ( Arabic for `` The Base `` ) is a loosely connected global network of Islamic terrorist groups that seek to expel U.S. troops from the Middle East , inflict revenge for what they perceive as America 's attacks on Muslims and its one - sided support of Israel , and eliminate Western cultural influences they consider contrary to Islam .
No evidence obtained to date suggests that Al Qa'ida has actually succeeded in producing significant quantities of chemical or biological agents or developed an effective means of delivery , but the intention to do so is clearly present .

Iran 's plans for building a civilian nuclear power program have prompted much concern regarding its intention to develop nuclear weapons .
In February 2003 , Iranian leaders announced a new plan to develop a nuclear energy plan using entirely domestic resources .
Iran has denied the charges that it is pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and argues that nuclear technology for civilian use is the right of every non - nuclear weapon state party to the NPT .
In April 2004 , Iran vowed to step up cooperation with the IAEA , adding that it had not only suspended enrichment programs but also stopped producing and assembling related parts .
Although Iran acceded to the Geneva Protocol in 1929 and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1973 , the U.S. government believes Iran began biological weapon efforts in the early to mid - 1980s , and that it continues to pursue an offensive biological weapon program linked to its civilian biotechnology activities .
Other sources suggest that while Iran is receiving assistance from both the PRC and DPRK with their missile programs , the two countries are working independently , but in coordination .
This test occurred just days before a meeting was to take place between Iran and European officials to discuss Iran 's nuclear program .
In addition to feeling threatened by Iraq 's growing nuclear program , these attacks may explain why the Khomeini government ultimately resumed its efforts to continue Iran 's nuclear power program and strengthen its existing nuclear research program -- and ultimately to develop nuclear weapons .
Responding to the barrage of critics who insist that Iran 's illicit intentions are obvious , El - Baradei has pointed to the continued absence of a `` smoking gun '' and the fundamental shortcomings of attempts to concretely assess Iran 's programmatic goals without such evidence .

After the Islamic Revolution , however , many leading nuclear scientists left the country , and in the 1990 , the AEOI reportedly employed `` around 200 scientists and 2,000 personnel engaged in nuclear research . ''
In 1990 , the Soviet Union and Iran began negotiating over the completion of the Bushehr reactors and the supply of additional nuclear plants .
Prior to Libya 's 19 December 2003 announcement to abandon its WMD programs , US intelligence agencies alleged that Qadhafi had attempted to recruit South African scientists to assist in the acquisition of BW , and that Libya had started to develop pathogens and toxins for weapons use . 
The U.S. responded by announcing in November 2002 that it would suspend heavy fuel oil shipments being provided under the terms of the Agreed Framework , which had led North Korea to freeze its plutonium production facilities . 
In September 1999 , Pyongyang agreed to a moratorium on missile flight tests and later announced that it would maintain the moratorium until at least 2003 . 
In April 2003 , Egyptian customs officials intercepted 22 tons of aluminum tubing from Germany that would likely have been used for a pilot cascade of about 100-200 gas centrifuges , which indicates North Korea is probably not yet ready to begin operation of a large-scale plant . 
The treaty requires a 90-day waiting period , but Pyongyang claimed the withdrawal was effective immediately because 89 days had transpired in 1993 when North Korea initially announced its intention to withdraw before `` suspending its intention to withdraw from the treaty . '' 
The treaty requires 90 - day notice before a withdrawal , but North Korea claims this is not necessary since Pyongyang already declared its intention to withdraw in 1993 , only to `` suspend its intention withdraw ''
Six rounds of inspections began in May 1992 and concluded in February 1993 .
The United States responded in December 2002 by suspending heavy oil shipments , and North Korea then retaliated by lifting the freeze on its nuclear facilities , expelling IAEA inspectors monitoring that freeze , and announcing its withdrawal from the NPT on 10 January 2003 .
The NPT withdrawal swiftly followed a December 2002 announcement that North Korea was lifting the freeze on its nuclear program , in response to the U.S. decision to suspend heavy fuel oil ( HFO ) shipments under the Agreed Framework .
There are also plans to start production of an upgraded SS-N-23 variant , designated Sineva , and the Air Force reportedly began to receive a new type of strategic cruise missile .
There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .

`` But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says .

Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .
There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .
Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .
The US is concerned that Iran may have or acquire an unsafeguarded enrichment facility for which it might get parts from Eastern Europe ( PPNN , International Herald Tribune , 1/28/91 ) .
Although Iran acceded to the Geneva Protocol in 1929 and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1973 , the U.S. government believes Iran began biological weapon efforts in the early to mid - 1980s , and that it continues to pursue an offensive biological weapon program linked to its civilian biotechnology activities .
Iran is trying to acquire fissile material to support development of nuclear weapons and has set up an elaborate system of military and civilian organizations to support its effort .
