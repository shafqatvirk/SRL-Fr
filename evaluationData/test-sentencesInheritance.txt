No evidence obtained to date suggests that Al Qa'ida has actually succeeded in producing significant quantities of chemical or biological agents or developed an effective means of delivery , but the intention to do so is clearly present .
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .

Although China claims that it no longer possesses any CW stockpiles , the U.S. government believes that China has not revealed the full scope of its program .
Given Iran 's strong biotechnology and pharmaceutical infrastructure , it is not difficult to envision the development of a concealed BW program .
The sophisticated research facilities in Iran could easily serve as a front for illicit BW - related activities and offer a legitimate excuse to import dual - use material .
If covert activities had in fact been taking place at this location , these inspections would have significantly jeopardized such efforts .
In this field , Iran 's research is concentrated in creating genes that produce toxins against insect pests ; improving the biological resistance of plants ; formulating new pesticides ; improving techniques of spraying or otherwise disseminating pesticides ; investigating the effects on native plant species after they have been introduced to various pests and diseases ; preventing the production of mycotoxins in crops ; producing plant viruses and their corresponding antiserums for an antiserum bank ; and manufacturing pheromones and hormones to combat arthropods that harm Iran 's agricultural industry .

Middle East Defense News reports that AKU has been used as a front company to purchase the following equipment from the United States : computers , Unix software , and training from NCR , Apple Computer , and Sun Microsystems , and neutron - shielding from Reactor Experiments , Inc . None of these technologies appears to be directly related to biological weapons .
Given its current state of technology and the problems associated with delivering a sophisticated BW agent , it is unlikely that Iran currently has the means to carry out a significant biological attack .
Iran has also conducted chemical and biological defense military exercises with helicopter sprayers and worked with cruise and ballistic missiles , although there is no concrete evidence that it has developed a biological warhead to be fit on such missiles .
Furthermore , Iran clearly possesses technology useful for producing biological weapons ( as will be elucidated in the Facilities section of this profile ) .
As there is no concrete mechanism for verifying government reports or allegations from exile groups , many of the allegations regarding the Iranian BW program remain unsubstantiated .
At the same time , it does have a very sophisticated biotechnology infrastructure that includes leading research facilities and trained personnel .
Under the deal , India will build a sophisticate chemical plant at Qazvin , which will be used produce phosphorous pentasulfide , a dual - use chemical that could be used to produce chemical weapons .

Iran has also conducted several military exercises to date that have included defensive chemical and biological weapons maneuvers .
The report mentions the sale of 58,000 gas masks by Shalon Chemical Industries after the Iran - Iraq War as well as the supply of gas detectors by Elbit for the identification of chemical warfare agents .
Iran has several advanced research institutions employing various chemicals for a variety of reasons , including pesticide production , pharmaceutical research , and other medical studies .
India also agreed to sell Iran phosphorous pentasulfide , a dual - use chemical used in the production of pesticides as well as the nerve agent VX .
In recent years , China has been the principal source of CW precursors , as well as production technology .
China has also been involved in several other sales to Iran , involving CW technology ; as a result , several Chinese companies and individuals have faced American sanctions .
China is a key supplier of CW equipment and technologies to Iran according to US Department of Defense .
According to US press reports citing a top secret CIA report , China sold Iran nearly 400 metric tons of chemicals used to produce nerve agents and riot control gas .
Intelligence reports regarding Iran 's expansion of capabilities and persistent interest in acquiring new technologies have led the United States to seek other options in dealing with Iran as a regional threat .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
Although the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) allows transfers of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to non - nuclear weapon states , the United States has vehemently opposed the Russian - Iranian deal .
Although Iran acceded to the Geneva Protocol in 1929 and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1973 , the U.S. government believes Iran began biological weapon efforts in the early to mid - 1980s , and that it continues to pursue an offensive biological weapon program linked to its civilian biotechnology activities .

Long - term assistance in the establishment of a factories to manufacture the HN-5A and HQ-2 .
Beginning in June 1986 , Iran initiated isolated Scud-B attacks against Baghdad and Kirkuk .
Building upon the foundations established during the war , Iran 's missile and long - range artillery rocket programs were reorganized during the late 1980s and have developed along two broad paths -- solid - fueled and liquid - fueled systems .
Primary among these are : The continued willingness of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) , the People's Republic of China ( PRC ) , and Russia to provide Iran with both missiles and missile - related technology that at the very least exceed the intentions of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
Faced with probability of sanctions and international isolation in case of noncompliance with the IAEA 's demands , Iran announced on 21 October 2003 that it will cooperate with the IAEA with full transparency and disclosure , sign the Additional Protocol and commence its ratification procedures , and suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities , albeit for an `` interim period . ''

''
A third approach might be a regional effort on the part of Arab states to pressure Iran to abandon sensitive technology and questionable activities in favor of a weapons - free zone in the Middle East .
He did this by shifting the country 's budgets toward the military and the newly established Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) .
The IAEA Board of Governors has imposed on Iran a 31 October 2003 deadline to resolve all outstanding issues and to provide full and complete declaration of its nuclear material and nuclear activities , specifically Iran 's enrichment program and past conversion experiments .
Training was most likely carried out under the direction of Abdul Qadeer Khan , former director of the Engineering Research Laboratories , later renamed the Dr . A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories ( Kahuta ) , where Pakistan 's nuclear weapons research and enrichment takes place .
The IAEA called on Iran to `` be proactive in taking all necessary steps on an urgent basis to resolve all outstanding issues '' , including those related to contamination by low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) and HEU , as well as the limited production of polonium - 210 and plutonium .
All Iran 's research activities in the recent past undoubtedly contribute to the future development of a complete nuclear fuel cycle , which in turn would enable Iran to weaponize without relying on outside assistance .
The most alarming developments were revealed in 2002 - 03 , during which time Iran admitted to having construction plans for two enrichment facilities , a heavy water production plant , a fuel fabrication plant , and undertaken research into conversion and enrichment activities ( including centrifuges and possibly lasers ) .
And while this claim has not yet been substantiated by IAEA inspectors , proponents argue that Iran has violated the NPT and that the country 's nuclear file should , in turn , be referred to the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) for its review .
Kazakhstani President Nazarbayev , however , has declared Kazakhstan 's commitment to the nonproliferation of BW and associated technologies .
On 19 December 2003 , Libyan leader Col. Muammar Qadhafi publicly confirmed his commitment to disclose and dismantle WMD programs in his country following a nine-month period of negotiations with US and UK authorities . 
In documentation provided to US and UK authorities in 2003 , Libya revealed a `` significant quantity '' of mustard agent produced more than 10 years ago at a facility near Rabta , located in the Sahara Desert about 120 km southwest of Tripoli , along with chemical munitions and equipment needed to establish a second CW production facility . 
There are allegations that the alleged chemical weapon ( CW ) plants at Rabta and Tarhunah could contain BW research facilities as well . 
In its 19 December 2003 announcement that it was eliminating all materials , equipment and programs proscribed by the international community , Libya took the unusual step of first publicly revealing its nuclear weapons program , then renouncing it . 
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
Kim Il Sung 's `` Declaration for Chemicalization '' in 1961 called for the further development of a chemical industry to support chemical weapons production , and the basic organization of the current Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau ( NCDB ) was also established during this time .
Recent estimates of North Korean chemical ordnance by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense ( MND ) have since been raised to the thousands of tons , probably based on recent information provided by North Korean defectors , including former members of DPRK military and NBC defence organizations .
The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
If official reports and testimonies from North Korean defectors are to be believed , the DPRK military possesses between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons .
Testing of agents is also reportedly performed at these two locations , possibly in very large underground facilities .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
North Korea has exported missiles , missile components , and technology to Egypt , Iran , Libya , Pakistan , Syria , and Yemen . 
North Korea has exported missiles , missile components , and technology to Egypt , Iran , Libya , Pakistan , Syria , and Yemen . 
North Korea has reportedly established a facility to produce UF6 at the Yongbyon nuclear complex , which gives Pyongyang the capability to produce the stock of uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) gas to feed the cascades of centrifuges in a large-scale plant . 
North Korea has reportedly established a facility to produce UF6 at the Yongbyon nuclear complex , which gives Pyongyang the capability to produce the stock of uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) gas to feed the cascades of centrifuges in a large-scale plant . 
Reports indicate that North Korea has some 12 CW facilities where raw chemicals , precursors , and actual agents are produced and / or stored , and six major storage depots for CW ordnance . 
Weapons programs can be based on indigenous ( i.e. , domestic ) production capabilities , or they can rely on foreign supplies and technologies .
While countries may seek to develop all of these capabilities on an independent , indigenous basis , they can and often do seek some inputs from foreign sources .
Key data sources for DPRK include defector testimony , which may be unreliable given possibility of deliberate disinformation by double agents and defectors exaggerating what they know , and unclassified estimates by US intelligence agencies , which may have certain biases based on national interest , worst - case expectations , domestic politics , etc. Also , most estimates do not rely on original texts in Korean , which may introduce some errors due to translation issues .

The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these clandestine programs .
In North Korea 's case , it was later discovered that the agency provided the wrong documents for the safeguards agreement and the IAEA subsequently gave North Korea an additional 18 months to complete the agreement .
From Washington 's perspective , `` improved implementation of the Agreed Framework '' meant an acceleration of safeguards inspections , even though the agreement did not require Pyongyang to submit to full safeguards inspections to verify its past activities until a significant portion of the reactor construction was completed but before the delivery of critical reactor components .

As talks with the United States over North Korea 's return to the NPT dragged on , North Korea continued to operate its 5MW ( e ) reactor in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun .
Under the terms of the agreement , North Korea provided an `` initial declaration '' of its nuclear facilities and materials , provided access for IAEA inspectors to verify the completeness and correctness of the initial declaration .
In the summer of 2002 , US intelligence reportedly discovered new evidence about transfers of HEU technology and/or materials from Pakistan in exchange for ballistic missiles .
Regardless of North Korean motivations toward South Korea and the United States , Pyongyang 's record of exporting ballistic missiles and missile production technology indicates that North Korea could also be willing to sell nuclear materials , technology , or even complete nuclear weapons .

The apartheid - era South African government viewed itself as the target of a `` total onslaught '' by Soviet-backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home , and to meet this all - encompassing `` red - black danger '' it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself .
South Africa acceded to the Treaty on the Non - Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) as a non - nuclear weapon state in 1991 , and International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspectors subsequently verified the completeness of its nuclear dismantlement .
There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .
While the proliferation legacies of South Africa 's nuclear and missile programs were effectively resolved through verified disarmament measures that won international acclaim , dismantlement of the country 's CBW capabilities was not verified to a comparable degree of certainty .
These claims have yet to be fully investigated , much less verified .
